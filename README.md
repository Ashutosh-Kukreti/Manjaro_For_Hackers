# Manjaro_For_Hackers
A simple bash script to install most used penetration testing and hacking tools on Manjaro Linux.

**Tools Included:**

1. Nmap
2. Metasploit
3. Wireshark
4. wifite2
5. aircrack-ng
6. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
7. Burpsuite 

Please make sure **AUR (ARCH User Repositry)** is enabled on your system.

**UPDATE:** Now the script will setup and configure Metasploit database automatically.

**Note1:** You will need to setup Metasploit database manually if the script does not work.

**Note2:** Neither I'm the creater nor the maintainer of these tools.

Type **Y** in the end to install wifite2 and burpsuite and **N** if you don't want to.
